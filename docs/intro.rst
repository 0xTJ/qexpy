Introduction
============

QExPy is a package whose goal is to reduce the time required to produce
lab reports for undergraduate students of Physics and Engineering Physics.
To reduce the time required to produce a lab report, the propagation of errors
and plotting of results has been moved into the background of the code as much
as possible. For example, a common lab preformed by first years is an
analysis of the stress and strain in a steel beam as one end is bent by a
measured amount. The next section contains an example of a Jupyter notebook
for said lab.
